Qus: Add at least 3 project features.

Ans:
1.User Authentication and Profiles:
Implement user authentication to allow users to create accounts, log in, and manage their donation activities. Each user can have a profile page where they can view their donation history, update their information, and track their contributions over time.
2.Donation Categories and Filtering:
Categorize donations into different types (e.g., food, clothing, education, healthcare) and allow users to filter and search for donations based on these categories. This feature will help users find the specific types of donations they are interested in more easily.
3.Donation Tracking and Impact Reporting:
Provide donors with information on how their contributions have made an impact. Create a dashboard that shows statistics and reports on the total donations received, the number of people helped, and the overall impact of the platform. This transparency can encourage more donations and build trust among users.
